### 2FA Security
- **TOTP over SMS:** App-based codes can't be intercepted
- **Offline capability:** Works without network connection
- **Time-limited:** Codes change every 30 seconds
- **Device-bound:** Tied to specific device/app

### Phone Security
- **No real number exposure:** Hushed number for services
- **Burner capability:** Can be replaced if compromised
- **No carrier vulnerabilities:** Not tied to real identity
- **Cost control:** Can let expire if not needed

### Payment Security
- **Virtual cards:** Can't be reused if compromised
- **Spending limits:** Damage control if breached
- **Fake billing:** No real address exposure
- **Instant cancellation:** Can be burned immediately

## Security Benefits Analysis

### App-based TOTP vs SMS
**TOTP Advantages:**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigated)
- **SIM Swapping:** Eliminated with TOTP
- **Data Breaches:** Limited impact with unique emails
- **Phishing:** Reduced with TOTP and unique emails
- **Social Engineering:** Harder with fake addresses

### Medium Risk (Reduced)
- **Address Verification:** Some services may require real address
- **Phone Verification:** Some services may require real phone
- **Payment Verification:** Some services may require real billing

### Low Risk (Acceptable)
- **Service Correlation:** Possible through usage patterns
- **Timing Analysis:** Possible through login patterns
- **Device Fingerprinting:** Possible through browser/device info

## Implementation Security

### 1Password Security
- **Encrypted vault:** All data encrypted at rest
- **Cloud sync:** Encrypted transmission
- **Master password:** Only you know it
- **2FA on vault:** Additional protection
- **Backup capability:** Can recover if needed

### Fastmail Security
- **Encrypted storage:** Emails encrypted at rest
- **TLS transmission:** Encrypted in transit
- **No tracking:** Privacy-focused provider
- **Alias system:** Built-in privacy feature

### Hushed Security
- **Encrypted messages:** SMS encrypted in transit
- **No logs:** Provider doesn't log messages
- **Burner capability:** Can be replaced
- **Privacy-focused:** Designed for anonymity

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable TOTP everywhere possible**
2. **Use unique emails for all services**
3. **Document everything in 1Password**
4. **Test the system with low-risk services**

### Ongoing Practices
1. **Regular security audits**
2. **Update passwords periodically**
3. **Monitor for data breaches**
4. **Review service permissions**

### Advanced Measures
1. **Consider VPN for additional privacy**
2. **Use different browsers for different purposes**
3. **Regular backup of 1Password vault**
4. **Monitor credit reports for identity theft**

## Compliance Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- **Government services:** May require real identity
- **Banking:** Must use real identity for compliance
- **Employment:** May require real identity
- **Utilities:** May require real address

### Service Terms
- **Some services prohibit fake information**
- **May require real phone numbers**
- **May verify addresses**
- **May require government ID**

### Best Practices
- **Use real identity only when legally required**
- **Use fake information only for non-critical services**
- **Be prepared to provide real information if challenged**
- **Document which services require real information**

## Attack Surface Analysis

### Reduced Attack Surface
- **Email:** Unique per service, can't be correlated
- **Phone:** Virtual number, can be replaced
- **Payment:** Virtual cards, can be burned
- **Address:** Fake address, no real location

### Remaining Attack Surface
- **Device fingerprinting:** Browser/device characteristics
- **Usage patterns:** Login times, locations
- **Service correlation:** Possible through behavior
- **Social connections:** People you interact with

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Use VPN:** Hide real IP address
- **Vary usage patterns:** Don't be predictable
- **Minimize social connections:** Keep networks separate
- **Regular rotation:** Change credentials periodically

## Security Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring
- **Check for unusual activity**
- **Monitor email for spam**
- **Review 1Password entries**
- **Check Privacy.com transactions**

### Weekly Monitoring
